The purpose of this project is to simulate a railway system. For simplicity there is only one line with no cross sections.  User can add a new station, specify the distance between the stations, edit and remove the stations if necessary.  User can also specify the capacity of the trains, the frequency of the trains and number of the trains. User should also specify the average quantity of people coming to a spesific station, waiing and times for the trains for that station. After everything is specified user can advance time to see how full are the trains, stations and how the system works. Then user can modify the parameters and observe the system so that the user can achieve optimal opereation strategy for the system.
> We are planning to realize our design by using Java programming language. We are planning to buid a simple GUI for adjusting parameters and showing the state of the system. However, since it will exceed the scope of the course we will not add any animations or graphical representations for the line, stations and trains.
> We decided to pick this topic for the project because we see high potential for expanding.  If the project wonâ€™t satisfy the requirements for the course, we can always add new features
